This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assets

This project expects certain dev-provided models:

* `public/hdr-winter-fantasy.jpg` - An HDR image used for environment background. Any can be used for this.
* `public/envelope.glb` - An animated envelope model (I used [this one](https://www.fab.com/listings/3e5bfd19-2c9b-45bc-b2b4-0443e9525c9c)). Any similar model with corresponding animations could be used.
